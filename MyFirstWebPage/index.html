<h2 id="story">Story</h2>
<p>This game is about X (the protagonist) and his friend, Zero. These robots are reploids. Reploids are robots that can think, feel for themselves and have free will like humans.</p>
<p>X and Zero are Maverick Hunters and their duty is to defeat any Maverick that they encounter in their journey.</p>
<p>Mavericks were former reploids, infected by a computer virus called "Maverick Virus."</p>
<p>The main antagonist is Sigma. A former reploid that was the leader of the Maverick Hunters but turned Maverick.</p>

<p>Once you defeat all Mavericks, you can enter the Fortress Stages and in the end you will fight Sigma himself.</p>
